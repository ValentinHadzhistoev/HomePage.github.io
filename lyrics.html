      <h5>    Alright!

        We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
        We're looking for you to start up a fight
        There is an evil feeling in our brains
        But there's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths

        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy

        There is no escape and that's for sure
        This is the end, we won't take any more
        Say goodbye to the world you live in
        You've always been taking and now you're giving

        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy

        Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
        And it will not go away until our dreams are fulfilled
        There is only one thing on our minds
        Don't try running away 'cause you're the one we will find

        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running, on our way, hiding
        You will pay dying
        One thousand deaths
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy</h5>
